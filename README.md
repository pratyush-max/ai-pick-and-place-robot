# Basic AI-Powered Pick and Place Robot

## Project Category
University / Community-Based Mini Project

## Problem Statement
Traditional robotic arms usually work on fixed instructions and lack adaptability. This project aims to develop a basic AI-powered robotic arm that can detect simple objects using a camera and perform pick-and-place operations accordingly.

## Project Description
This mini project focuses on building a beginner-friendly robotic pick-and-place system using a camera, basic computer vision techniques, and a robotic arm controlled by a microcontroller. The system demonstrates how artificial intelligence and hardware can work together for automation tasks at an introductory level.

## Objectives
- To design a basic robotic arm capable of pick-and-place operations
- To use computer vision for simple object detection
- To integrate vision output with robotic movement
- To gain hands-on experience with AI, Arduino, and system integration

## Proposed Solution
1. Use a camera to capture real-time video.
2. Detect simple objects using OpenCV.
3. Send control signals to Arduino.
4. Move the robotic arm to pick and place objects.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Arduino (Embedded C)
- USB Camera
- Servo Motors

## Project Status
Initial Phase – Repository created for problem statement submission.

## Expected Outcome
A working demonstration of a basic AI-powered robotic arm capable of detecting and picking simple objects.
